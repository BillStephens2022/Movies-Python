# Top 10 Movies - Python - Flask<br>![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

  ## Description

  A web application where users can add their favorite movies which get displayed as cards 
  on the screen with the background image of the movie poster.  Once a movie is added, the
  user is asked to provide a rating and short review.  When the user hovers over the card,
  the card flips to the backside which shows the year, description, rating, and review. From
  there, the user can update the rating/review or delete the movie.  This app was built with 
  Python Flask, SQLite / SQLAlchemy, and The Movie Datatabase (TMDB) API.
